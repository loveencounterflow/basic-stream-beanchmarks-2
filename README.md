> Charts: **(Top)** marked, linear increase of processing time with number of pass-through transforms for
> PipeDreams and Readable-Stream models; Pull-Stream remains unaffected.â€”**(Bottom)** in terms of
> items (lines) per second (ips) of throughput, Readable-Stream performance caves in from ~40,000ips to
> around 5,000ips with a mere 100 No-Ops more in the pipeline. PipeDreams presumably worse as it makes heavy
> use of composed stream transforms internally. Pull-Stream remains essentially uneffected; small,
> counter-intuitive *increase* of throughput remains unexplained.
